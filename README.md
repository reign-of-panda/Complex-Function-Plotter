# Complex-Function-Plotter
This is a project where I am graphing complex functions to explore and learn about data visualisation tools in Python. 

The .py file in this repository contains code that plots complex functions using matplotlib 2D graphs, contour plots, and 3D graphs. 
I am programming a complex function grapher to improve my knowledge of Python's data visualisation tools.
